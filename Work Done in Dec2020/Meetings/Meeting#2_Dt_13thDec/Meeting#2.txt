---------------------------------------------------------------
Carry from last week:
4 binaries, write the program to accept the binary in the command line, then:
->Find out the source language and target types architecture ( to give important details of the files ) 


{ GO, Whatsapp(Erlang) } (Optional)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 1:
Write some simple program (leaking memory)

shell scriptwriting program, installation scripts, it places some program on 

simple c program should allocate 1024 bytes ++ memory continuously.
get a.out -> write installation script > this should 
from the folder {  script.sh   a.out  } pick a.out place it in a different location and run from that location.

run install.sh

>>how does the installation happen?
install at some Location, a.out should be placed in a location, and run a.out in background.

after some time program starts allocating excess of memory,

Study: while loops, iterations in binary code

see: the degradation of system {fan will turn on, delays}

---------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise 2:
behaviour install.sh is same

on any Linux machine, there is a doc folder
extract the name of the user.
identify files (read) should find and save some encrypted files in an encrypted folder.
erase that original file

./install.sh >> /home/name >> read a file >> encrypt it >> mcd "Encrypt_Folder" >> put encrypted data there >> erase original file >> put decryption key in a "Transmission_Folder"

compilation of install script,
later all in one file

figure out the system calls, in a memory leak, in second ex syscall to encrypt calls, deleted calls etc.
Identify the while loop how the while loop in binary, after that iteration is to do good/bad things

Connect to automata theory AB(CD)* -> loop at CD

put enc Key in some transmission folder
