>Languages like PERL, Java, JavaScript, and C# use built-in safety mechanisms that minimize the likelihood of buffer overflow.
>Stack-based buffer overflows are the most common. They use stack memory, which exists during the execution time of a function.
>Heap-based attacks involve flooding the memory space allocated for a program beyond the memory used for current runtime operations. These attacks are harder to carry out than stack-based.
