`Shellcode Injection`

compile the *.c file with `gcc -z execstack -o hello hello.c`
Now to give shellcode as input use `(cat shellcode-raw; cat) | ./hello`


To assemble *.s file
`gcc -nostdlib -static shellcode.s -o shellcode-elf`

Now this is an ELF file with your shellcode as its .text. You still need to extract it:
`objcopy --dump-section .text=shellcode-raw shellcode-elf`
