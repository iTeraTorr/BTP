a. Explore self-replication and how can that be captured in our malware
b.1 Read Cohen's Paper completely
b.2 Read "Property Templates for Checking Source Code Security" paper
c. Read up about Spyware, Ransomware, and Virus. Download one binary of each from recent times.
d. Disassemble them
e. run strace on our malware
f. Discriminate b/w normal system calls(from empty program) ->set_0 and call from our malware->set_1
g. (set_1-set_0) gives system call signature of the malware
h. Do readelf/objdump/strace on the downloaded binary, to get set of system calls-> set_2
i. Observe that set_2 is very similar to (set_1-set_0).
j. Make a live USB containing Ubuntu 18.04 and another USB containing the downloaded ransomware. And use it as a sandbox environment so execute the binary and loopup the system calls.
k. Create AppImage of Ransomware
l. Vulnerability Analyzer of AppImage files
m. https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3127041.3127063

Project-Signal-Desktop
a. Get a count of Ascii files, Binary files, etc.
b. Do disassembly of binary files and find socket calls in it and store disassembly in file_n.disassembly
c. Identify assembly instructions relevent to socket communication and put them into file, keywords.txt
d. Search for each keyword in all the disassembly files that we created in step b.
